"""Endpoint constants for GTSW (Tomahawk 6 / IcePack) multi-node PFC.

Source ports live on ``gtsw001.l1001.c085.ash6``; the destination port
lives on ``gtsw001.l1002.c085.ash6`` (sibling pod in the same cluster).
Both DUTs peer with the identical 8-STSW spine plane in ``l201.ash6``
(``stsw001.s001..s008.l201.ash6``), so traffic converges
gtsw001.l1001 → 8× STSW → gtsw001.l1002 and PFC backpressure propagates
across the fabric rather than staying inside one box.

The methodology doc originally called out ``gtsw002.l1001`` as the
destination; ash6 c085 has no IXIA cabling to gtsw002 today, but
``gtsw001.l1002`` is IXIA-anchored on ixia20 and shares the identical
STSW plane, so it exercises the same multi-node PFC path.

Companion methodology doc: fburl.com/gsheet/qhif4j0m + the primary
"GTSW (Tomahawk 6) Multi-Node PFC Test Methodology" gdoc.
