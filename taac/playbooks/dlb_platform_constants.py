"""Platform-aware DLB (Dynamic Load Balancing) resource sizing constants.

The number of unique ECMP groups a switch can program for DLB ("ARS groups")
is an ASIC hardware property, so the DLB resource-stickiness checks must assert
different expected values per platform. Centralizing those numbers here (rather
than hardcoding them in ``playbook_definitions.py``) lets the same ECMP-resource
playbooks serve multiple platforms — the playbook looks up a profile by ASIC and
the per-platform numbers live in exactly one place.

Empirical DLB cap references:
- Tomahawk3 (Wedge400): max 10 DLB ECMP groups on c085 despite
  ``Tomahawk3Asic.cpp getMaxArsGroups()=16`` with
  ``FLAGS_use_full_dlb_scale=true``. See T267963572.
- Tomahawk5 (Minipack3): max 94 DLB ECMP groups.
