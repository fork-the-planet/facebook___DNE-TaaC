    Empties / recovers update groups by bringing the IXIA-emulated peers' BGP
    SESSIONS down/up -- NOT by toggling their DeviceGroups. This is deliberate:

    - ``toggle_device_groups(enable=False)`` removes the whole emulated router
      and de-materializes its IXIA-imported route range (the eBGP prefixes come
      from a one-shot ``ImportBgpRoutes`` at setup). Nothing ever re-imports, so
      after recovery the peers advertise NOTHING and the DUT has no eBGP routes
      to redistribute to iBGP -- the recovery never actually re-syncs routes,
      and any distribution check (spec step 10) sees an empty dump.
    - ``start_bgp_peers`` only stops/starts the BGP protocol; the emulated
      routers and their imported route ranges stay materialized, so on ``start``
      the peers re-advertise their routes -- exactly what a real peer does when
      it flaps. This makes the recovery genuinely restore the route state (spec
      pass-criterion "full route re-sync") and lets step 10 verify distribution.
      It also matches the spec wording ("shut down ALL eBGP sessions").

    Omits the session indices so ``start_bgp_peers`` flaps each matched peer's
    FULL session range (the API defaults ``session_end_idx`` to each peer's own
    ``Count``); ``create_start_stop_bgp_peers_step`` can't express "all sessions"
    across peers with differing session counts, hence the direct API step.

    """Build the BGP++ Update Group qualification 2.9.7 playbook
    (Empty Group — Last Peer Goes Down Without Detached Peers).

    Intent (spec 2.9.7): shutting every peer in a group (empty group), and
    then every peer in every group, must not crash the BGP daemon; the
    update groups must re-form cleanly on recovery with no stale routes.

    Flow — the groups are emptied / recovered by STOPPING and STARTING the
    IXIA-emulated peers' BGP SESSIONS (``start_bgp_peers``), NOT by toggling
    their DeviceGroups. See ``_flap_bgp_peers`` for the full rationale: session
    stop/start leaves the imported eBGP route ranges materialized, so recovery
    genuinely re-syncs routes (DeviceGroup toggling de-materializes them and the
    recovery would advertise nothing, defeating spec step 10). It also matches
    the spec wording ("shut down ALL eBGP sessions"). ``settle_after_flap_s``
    gives the DUT time to tear the sessions down and empty the groups after each
    stop (90s default, ample for the EBB hold-times):

      1. Empty the eBGP update group: stop ALL eBGP BGP sessions
         (``ebgp_peer_regex``). Settle, then verify
         no crash; the eBGP sessions actually went down (0 eBGP Established --
         a non-vacuous guard against a mis-matched regex, when
         ``non_ebgp_parent_prefixes`` is supplied); the eBGP UPDATE GROUP
         itself emptied on the device (``expect_empty_peer_groups`` -- spec
         "group with zero members"); AND the iBGP update group is still
         enabled/formed (isolation -- emptying one group must not disturb the
         others).
      2. Soak with the eBGP group empty (spec step 4: default 5 minutes).
      3. Empty ALL groups: stop ALL iBGP BGP sessions too
         (``ibgp_peer_regex``). Every update group is now empty (the "last
         peer goes down" condition). Verify no crash; 0 sessions Established
         (excluding BGP-MON); AND both update groups empty on the device
         (``expect_empty_peer_groups`` for eBGP + iBGP).
      4. Soak with all groups empty (spec step 7: default 2 minutes).
      5. Recover: start ALL eBGP then ALL iBGP BGP sessions, then (if
         ``ebgp_prefix_pool_regex`` is set) withdraw + re-advertise the eBGP
         prefix pool so IXIA actually re-sends the imported eBGP routes -- a bare
         session-up does NOT re-advertise them, so without this the DUT relearns
         0 eBGP routes and recovery re-syncs nothing. Then wait
         ``recovery_convergence_s`` for the ~640-session topology to begin
         re-establishing, then verify no crash, the update groups re-formed
         (eBGP + iBGP), and sessions re-established. When
         ``expected_recovered_group_count`` is supplied, ALSO assert the total
         update-group count returned to the pre-test baseline (spec: groups
         re-created correctly, no stale/orphaned groups left from the empty
         period). The session-establish check retries
         (``recovery_session_retry_*``) to absorb full-scale re-convergence
         timing. "No stale routes" is asserted by the postchecks
         (``BGP_STANDARD_POSTCHECKS``), which run after the full 600s
         convergence budget rather than at this mid-test point.

    Spec step 3 (``ibgp_inject_pool_regex``): between stages 1 and 2, inject
    ``inject_route_count`` iBGP routes (withdraw then re-advertise) and re-check
    the iBGP update group -- verifies iBGP keeps functioning while the eBGP group
    is empty. Spec step 10 (``ibgp_dump_*``): a final tcpdump dump-compare that
    asserts two iBGP peers in one update group receive identical UPDATEs -- the
    only UG-immune per-peer distribution check (adj-RIB-out is vacuous under UG
    per T271301144; the sent-prefix gauge read 0 on bag011). It cold-starts ONLY
    the iBGP sink peers (``flap_peer_regex`` = the dump peer set) so the eBGP
    route sources stay up and the DUT still holds the routes to dump; it flaps
    those peers, so it runs LAST. Both are skipped if their params are omitted.

    ``bgp_mon_ignore_prefixes`` (if the testbed has BGP-MON peers configured
    on the device that IXIA does not emulate) is threaded into the session
    checks so those intentionally-down peers do not fail them.

    ``non_ebgp_parent_prefixes`` (the iBGP + BGP-MON parent networks) scopes
    the Stage-1 "eBGP actually emptied" assertion to eBGP-only. If omitted,
    that assertion is skipped (the Stage-3 all-empty assertion still proves
    the toggles took effect). See spec 2.9.7 in the qualification plan.

# =============================================================================
# 2.9.2 Simultaneous Disruptions Across All Groups
# =============================================================================
#
# The spec runs FOUR disruption types concurrently for 30 minutes -- eBGP route
# churn (with varying communities), random eBGP session flaps (without graceful
# restart), IGP-metric instability via Open/R, and iBGP LOCAL_PREF churn -- while
# monitoring that the iBGP update group stays stable (sessions Established, no
# crash, CPU/load bounded), then stops everything, waits for convergence, and
# verifies recovery + a bounded VmHWM growth. Modeled as ONE concurrent
# ``create_steps_stage`` with one ``ConcurrentStep`` per disruption track plus a
# monitor track and a spanning VmHWM-growth track (each ConcurrentStep is an
# independent asyncio task; the stage ends when the longest finishes), followed by
# a sequential convergence-verify stage. Each track's total sleep sums to
# ~``disruption_duration_s`` so the whole stage runs for the intended window.
#
# Distribution/route-count verification (spec pass-criterion 3) is intentionally
# NOT asserted: adj-RIB-out is vacuous under UG (T271301144) and the DUT
# advertises 0 on this topology pending a DNE egress-policy answer, so the
# landable substance here is stability (no crash, iBGP stays up, CPU/mem/load
# bounded) -- which is exactly what 2.9.2 stresses, and it directly exercises the
# known cross-group bugs T275928998 / T264949859.

    """Build the BGP++ Update Group qualification 2.9.2 playbook (Simultaneous
    Disruptions Across All Groups).

    Intent (spec 2.9.2): under FOUR concurrent disruption types the BGP++ agent
    must not crash and the iBGP update group must stay stable (all iBGP sessions
    Established throughout), and after the disruption stops it must reconverge
    cleanly with bounded memory growth. This is the "kitchen-sink" UG stress test.

    Structure -- one concurrent stage of six tracks running ``disruption_duration_s``
    (default 30 min):
      1. Route churn (``_route_churn_track_steps``): every ``route_churn_interval_s``
         withdraw + re-advertise ``route_churn_count`` eBGP routes, rotating the
         community.
      2. Session flaps (``_session_flap_track_steps``): every
         ``session_flap_interval_s`` flap ``flap_random_session_num`` RANDOM eBGP
         sessions (GR-off, so a real "no graceful restart" flap per spec).
      3. Attribute churn (``_attribute_churn_track_steps``): every
         ``attr_churn_interval_s`` toggle LOCAL_PREF on ``attr_churn_count`` iBGP
         routes between ``local_pref_low`` and ``local_pref_high``.
      4. IGP instability: one self-running ``create_openr_route_action_step``
         (``METRIC_OSCILLATION``) oscillating Open/R metrics toward the injected
         PNHs for the whole window (needs the WITH_OPEN_R profile).
      5. VmHWM growth gate: one spanning ``bgp_vmhwm_growth_monitor`` custom step
         that captures VmHWM, waits the window, re-reads, and FAILs if growth
         exceeds ``vmhwm_growth_threshold_bytes`` (spec pass-criterion 4).
      6. Monitor (``_monitor_track_steps``): every ``monitor_interval_s`` assert
         no crash + iBGP Established + system load-average bound (the EOS
         device-CPU signal; a per-process bgpcpp CPU% gate is intentionally not
         used -- it reads >100% under churn and isn't the spec's device "40%").

    Then a sequential convergence stage: re-inject the Open/R routes to restore
    baseline IGP metrics, quiesce ``convergence_quiesce_s`` (default 5 min), and
    verify no crash + ALL sessions re-Established (excl BGP-MON) + UG still formed.

    ``non_ibgp_parent_prefixes`` (eBGP v6/v4 + BGP-MON parents) scopes the
    "iBGP Established throughout" check to iBGP only, since eBGP is intentionally
    being flapped. ``bgp_mon_ignore_prefixes`` scopes the recovery all-sessions
    check to exclude the never-emulated BGP-MON peers.

    Route-count / distribution verification (spec pass-criterion 3) is not
    asserted -- adj-RIB-out is vacuous under UG (T271301144) and the DUT advertises
    0 on this topology pending a DNE egress answer -- so the substance here is the
    stability/no-crash/no-flap/bounded-resource invariants (the rest of 2.9.2's
    pass criteria), which directly exercise the known cross-group bugs
    T275928998 / T264949859.
