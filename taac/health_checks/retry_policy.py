"""Single source of truth (SSOT) for TAAC health-check retry policy.

Retry is a property of the **check**, uniform across the pre-check and
post-check phases and across every Conveyor test that runs the check — it is
never decided per call site. This module is that single source of truth; the
standardized check bundles / profile registry read it instead of hand-passing
retry numbers (which is what previously allowed the numbers to drift).

Two failure kinds are retried differently (see
``AbstractPointInTimeHealthCheck.run``):

* **Transient data-fetch failure** — a check's ``_run`` raises (dropped RPC,
  timeout, empty read). This is not a real verdict, so it is retried for
  *every* check (static and stateful) until retries are exhausted, then
  surfaced as ERROR.
* **A FAIL verdict** — retried only for **stateful** checks (those whose state
  settles after a perturbation). **Static** checks read fixed config/inventory,
  so a real FAIL will not change on retry; they opt out via
  ``RETRY_ON_FAIL = False`` on the check class.

Keying is by ``CheckName`` alone. Different check *types* may carry different
numbers (e.g. a check that needs longer to settle), but a given check's numbers
are identical in every phase and every test.
