"""Shared IXIA-wiring helpers for EBB factories.

Wave 4.5B retired the ``_lab_device_wiring`` helper — its output
(``host_driver_args`` + ``oss_mock_device_data``) is now stored on
``Testbed`` as first-class fields, so factories read the values
directly from the testbed object instead of calling a helper. This
module now only hosts ``_direct_ixia_conns_two_port``, which stays a
helper because it derives from ``testbed.ixia_ports`` (a runtime layout
that does not fit cleanly on the frozen dataclass).
