"""Shared disrupt-window health-check contract for the FPF service-kill tests.

The bgp/wedge_agent/fsdb "SIGKILL every Ns for M min" configs (tc49/tc50/tc51)
all kill ONE service on the DUT GTSW (gtsw001, which owns the impacted lane) for
the whole kill loop. During that loop the per-lane HRT/RDMA "collector" signals
(session census, host-spray, bulk/remote-failure/prod-prefix convergence) are
deliberately perturbed — the impacted lane churns on every kill — so they carry
no stable verdict here. They are therefore asserted FULL-STRENGTH in the
stable-state longevity playbook instead, NOT in this disrupt window.

The disrupt window asserts only the "did the kill break something it shouldn't"
safety signals, which differ by service:

  killed service │ bgp up? │ ports up? │ exclude (systemctl) │ unclean-exit asserted?
  ───────────────┼─────────┼───────────┼─────────────────────┼───────────────────────
  fsdb           │  yes    │   yes     │ fsdb                │ yes (minus fsdb)
  bgpd           │  no     │   yes     │ bgpd                │ yes (minus bgpd)
  wedge_agent    │  no     │   no      │ wedge_agent + bgpd  │ NO (coldboot teardown
                 │         │           │   (BindsTo)         │   is legitimately unclean)

Asserted in the disrupt window for all three:
  - SYSTEMCTL_ACTIVE_STATE (minus killed/cascaded) — others stay active
  - UNCLEAN_EXIT (minus killed/cascaded)           — EXCEPT wedge_agent (see above)
  - DEVICE_CORE_DUMPS                              — no new core dumps
  - FPF_HRT_SYSTEM_MEMORY / DRIVER_DISCONNECT      — HRT process healthy
  - GENERIC_ODS discards                           — in_dst_null & in_discard captured
                                                     (informational), congestion == 0
  - FPF_BGP_RIB_CONVERGENCE                        — ONLY when bgpd stays up (fsdb
                                                     kill): the RIB must NOT be
                                                     impacted by an fsdb restart.

NOT asserted in the disrupt window (judged in the longevity playbook instead):
FPF_HRT_FSDB_SESSION, FPF_HOST_SPRAY, FPF_HRT_BULK, FPF_HRT_REMOTE_FAILURE,
FPF_PROD_HRT_PREFIX.
