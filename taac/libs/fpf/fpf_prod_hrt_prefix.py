"""Core reachability model for production HRT prefix monitoring.

Shared by the standalone collector binary
(``scripts/pavanpatil/fpf_prod_hrt_prefix_collector.py``) and the TAAC
``ProdHrtPrefixCollector``. Turns the three HRT thrift APIs
(``getPrefixTable`` / ``getRemoteFailures`` / ``getPlaneStatus``) into a
per-prefix reachability data class:

  - reachable_planes   : planes the prefix is programmed on and NOT drained/failed
  - drained_planes     : planes marked drained for the prefix
  - unreachable_planes : planes in remote-failure (negative route) for the prefix
  - plane_up           : planes whose getPlaneStatus PlaneState is UP
  - plane_down         : planes whose state is anything else (DRAINED / UNKNOWN)
  - device_ids         : GPU device_id(s) on the host carrying the prefix

Plane lists are unioned across the host's matching device entries.
